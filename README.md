# Selenium_DNSMarket_test_project \n
#Task: create an autotest, with Pyrhon+Selenium, to test the full "business path" for a client to buy any product from the catalog. 
#Due to the fact that I have no connection with the developers of the site, the test was compiled only till the ordering page, namely, entering the SMS sent to the phone number.
#The "base" folder stores methods applied to any page of the site
#The "pages" folder contains .py documents for each individual page of the site, with its own locators, getas and methods
#The "screen" folder contains screenshots made during test
#The "docs" folder i use to save .txt files where i save information about products
#The "test" folder cantains files directly with tests
#Folders "logs" and "test_results" are both about logging. "logs" for logging files, "test_results" - contains all files for allure reports
